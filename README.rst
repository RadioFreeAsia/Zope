Introduction
============

Zope2 is an open-source web application server.

This document provides some general information about Zope2 and provides
links to other documents.

Installation information can be found in ``docs/INSTALL.rst``.  Other
documentation is also in the "docs" directory and in the zope.org
documentation section at http://docs.zope.org/ .

General Zope information is available at http://www.zope.org/

Installation
============

Follow the instructions in ``docs/INSTALL.rst`` to install Zope.

If you do not have a source checkout with docs, you can find the latest
install docs online at
https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.rst

Note that you *cannot* simply do ``easy_install zope2`` or
``pip install zope2``, because you need specific versions of all
dependencies. Follow the documentation to ensure you get the correct
versions, or else installation is very likely to fail.
